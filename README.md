# Methods

I am going to be using this as a means of improving my standing as a developer and particularly to branch out into backend development. In the past, I have neglected my data structures and algorithms because I have been a native Android developer, and they are not particularly used in that field.

My solutions will be written in Kotlin, as that is the language that I am comfortable with, and my plan is to pursue backend with Spring, so it will improve my knowledge of the language for the future.

I will also be using IntelliJ IDEA as my IDE of choice for this, because it is similar to Android Studio, and designed with Kotlin in mind. Although I want to also learn VIM motions in the future so I might switch to NeoVim or just use the IdeaVim plugin.
